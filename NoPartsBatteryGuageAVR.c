/*
 * NoPartsBatteryGuageAVR.c
 *
 * This is a simplified demonstration of how to detect power supply voltage by using the on chip 
 * analog-to-digital converter to measure the voltage of the internal band-gap reference voltage. 
 *
 * The code will read the current power supply voltage, and then blink an LED attached to pin 6 (PA7). 
 *
 * 1 blink  = 1 volts <= Vcc < 2 volts	(only applicable on low voltage parts like ATTINY84AV)
 * 2 blinks = 2 volts <= Vcc < 3 volts 
 * 2 blinks = 2 volts <= Vcc < 3 volts
 * 3 blinks = 3 volts <= Vcc < 4 volts
 * 4 blinks = 4 volts <= Vcc < 5 volts
 * 5 blinks = 5 volts <= Vcc  
 *
 * 0 blinks = power supply turned off :) 
 *
 * This code was tested on an ATTINY84A with default fuse settings, but should work unchanged on 
 * any ATTINYx4 or ATTINYx4A, and should be easily ported to any 8-bit AVR with ADC and internal 1.1 reference voltage.
 *
 * More info at...

The device is shipped with CKSEL = “0010”, SUT = “10”, and CKDIV8 programmed. The default
clock source setting is therefore the Internal Oscillator running at 8.0 MHz with longest start-up
time and an initial system clock prescaling of 8, resulting in 1.0 MHz system clock.
